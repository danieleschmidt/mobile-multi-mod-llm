- Mobile model artifact packaging and distribution

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
```yaml
# Required for PyPI publishing
PYPI_API_TOKEN: "pypi-xxxx"

# Required for Codecov (optional)
CODECOV_TOKEN: "xxxx"
```

### GitHub Permissions
The repository needs the following permissions:
- `contents: write` - For creating releases
- `packages: write` - For publishing Docker images
- `security-events: write` - For security scanning
- `id-token: write` - For SLSA provenance

### Branch Protection Rules
Configure the following branch protection for `main`:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require review from code owners
- Include administrators in restrictions
