## ADR-001: INT2 Quantization for Hexagon NPU

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: @danieleschmidt, ML Team

### Context
We need to achieve sub-35MB model size while maintaining high accuracy for mobile deployment on Qualcomm Hexagon NPU.

### Decision
Implement INT2 quantization targeting Qualcomm Hexagon NPU with custom quantization-aware training.

### Rationale
- INT2 provides 4x model size reduction compared to FP32
- Hexagon NPU has native INT2 matrix multiplication support
- Custom quantization maintains accuracy better than post-training quantization
- Enables real-time inference on mobile devices

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Dramatic size reduction, hardware acceleration, energy efficiency
- **Negative**: Complex quantization pipeline, potential accuracy degradation
- **Risks**: Limited debugging tools, hardware-specific implementation

### Implementation
- Neural Architecture Search for quantization-friendly architectures
- Progressive quantization during training
- Calibration dataset for optimal quantization parameters

## ADR-002: Multi-Task Learning Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: @danieleschmidt, ML Team

### Context
Support multiple vision-language tasks (captioning, OCR, VQA, retrieval) in a single model.

### Decision
Shared vision encoder with task-specific decoder heads and dynamic routing.

### Rationale
- Shared representations reduce model size
- Task-specific heads maintain specialization
- Dynamic routing optimizes inference for single tasks
- Joint training improves overall performance

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Unified model, shared learning, efficient inference
- **Negative**: Complex training dynamics, potential task interference
- **Risks**: Optimization challenges, debugging complexity

### Implementation
- Transformer-based shared encoder
- Lightweight task-specific heads
- Gradient balancing for multi-task training

## ADR-003: Mobile-First Security Model

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: Security Team, @danieleschmidt

### Context
Mobile deployment requires enhanced security due to limited sandboxing and potential reverse engineering.

### Decision
Implement defense-in-depth security with model obfuscation, secure serialization, and runtime protections.

### Rationale
- On-device models are vulnerable to extraction
- Traditional pickle serialization has security risks
- Mobile apps need tamper detection
- Privacy regulations require data protection

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enhanced security, regulatory compliance, user trust
- **Negative**: Additional complexity, performance overhead
- **Risks**: Security through obscurity limitations

### Implementation
- Safetensors for secure model serialization
- Model weight obfuscation techniques
- Runtime integrity checks
- Secure key management for protected operations

## ADR-004: Docker-First Development Environment

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: DevOps Team, @danieleschmidt

### Context
Complex ML development requires consistent environments across team members and CI/CD.

### Decision
Multi-stage Docker containers with specialized environments for development, testing, and production.

### Rationale
- Consistent environments reduce "works on my machine" issues
- GPU and mobile SDK dependencies are complex
- Isolation improves security and reproducibility
- Facilitates cloud deployment and scaling

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Environment consistency, easy onboarding, scalable deployment
- **Negative**: Docker learning curve, resource overhead
- **Risks**: Container security, dependency management

### Implementation
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for different environments
- Docker Compose for development orchestration
- Volume mounting for development iteration
- Specialized containers for GPU and mobile development

## ADR-005: Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Decision Makers**: SRE Team, @danieleschmidt

### Context
ML models in production require specialized monitoring beyond traditional application metrics.

### Decision
Implement Prometheus/Grafana stack with custom ML metrics and mobile-specific observability.

### Rationale
- Model performance can degrade over time
- Mobile devices have unique constraints (battery, network, compute)
- Quantized models need accuracy monitoring
- Production debugging requires detailed observability

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Proactive issue detection, performance optimization, user experience monitoring
- **Negative**: Additional infrastructure complexity, storage requirements
- **Risks**: Metric explosion, privacy considerations

### Implementation
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization and alerting
- Custom metrics for model accuracy, latency, and mobile-specific KPIs
- Integration with mobile app telemetry
