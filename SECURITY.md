# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Mobile Multi-Modal LLM, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: **security@terragon.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix development**: Varies by severity
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes    |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No     |

## Security Considerations

### Model Security

- **Adversarial inputs**: Models may be vulnerable to adversarial examples
- **Data poisoning**: Be cautious with untrusted training data
- **Model extraction**: Protect model weights in production
- **Privacy**: Ensure on-device processing for sensitive data

### Mobile Security

- **App signing**: Always sign mobile applications properly
- **Certificate pinning**: Implement for API communications
- **Root/jailbreak detection**: Consider for high-security applications
- **Secure storage**: Use platform keystore for sensitive data

### Dependencies

- **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies current with security patches
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Automated scanning with bandit and safety
- **License compliance**: Ensure compatible licenses for all dependencies

### Development Security

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Security scanning before commits
- **Secrets management**: Never commit credentials or API keys
- **Code review**: All changes require security-aware review
- **Access control**: Limit repository access and permissions

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Verify downloads**: Check hashes and signatures
3. **Secure deployment**: Follow mobile security guidelines
4. **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs to the model
5. **Error handling**: Don't expose internal details in errors

### For Contributors

1. **Security training**: Understand common vulnerabilities
2. **Secure coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
3. **Dependency review**: Audit new dependencies
4. **Testing**: Include security test cases
5. **Documentation**: Document security implications

## Security Tools

We use the following tools for security:

- **bandit**: Python security linter
- **safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **GitGuardian**: Secret detection in commits
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis

## Compliance

### Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular assessment
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

### AI/ML Specific

- **Model privacy**: Data minimization principles
- **Bias mitigation**: Fair and unbiased model behavior
- **Explainability**: Understanding model decisions
- **Robustness**: Reliable performance under various conditions
